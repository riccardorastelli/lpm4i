Latent Position Network Models for Influence

This package implements a latent position network model that can be used to characterise dynamic nodal information. This can be used to obtain a latent space representation of a dynamic network, and thus analyse potential influence between nodes.

The package accompanies the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11488
